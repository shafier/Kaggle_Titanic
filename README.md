Reader's level = Novice level in the Data Science field, and Machine Learning models

I am a beginner on the Data Science field, and Machine Learning models.
This shows my first work on these intriguing subjects. 
The aim of this work is to get understanding of those both topics.

Why did I do this? 
There are heaps of materials out there in the internet, and I read some of them with the goal to gain understanding what they are. 
However I became confused and frustrated. This is because most of them only show the first "layer" of the 2 topics.   
They did not give me the necessary "ingredients" or the fundamentals to build the skill I need.  
I learned in my experiences, the best way to learn is to do it. Nevertheless, this is combined with reading relevant articles/books/kernels.

I hope this helps you in your journey to comprehend the Data Science field, and Machine Learning models
